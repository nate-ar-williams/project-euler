read in digits
index pointing to start of series and end
difference/distance between indices must always be 12
multiply 13 digits contained in indices
store as max
range 13 to digitLength
	increase startIndex and endIndex
	div by digits[startIndex] (not 0)
	multiply by digits[endIndex]
	if new product > maxProduct, set maxProduct to newProduct

potential optimizations:
	skip entirely over any series containing a 0
	skip if digits[newIndex] < digits[oldIndex] ?
