to find smallestMultiple of n
for i in range(n):
	find prime factorization of i, including # of times a factor appears
	multiply prime factors 
	
how to find prime factorization of n:
	while factor > 1
		div by each prime < sqrt(n)
	

how to generate primes:
	just div by other primes
	OR use list of bools
