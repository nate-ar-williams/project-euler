euclid's formula

m > n > 0
m and n are coprime, not both odd
coprime means they're only both divisible by 1; any prime that divids one doesn't divide the other
AKA their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1


a = k * (m^2 - n^2)
b = k * (2mn)
c = k * (a^2 + b^2)

need a way of generating two coprime numbers
	first number, m, is > 1
	n < m
	if m is odd, n must be even
	ensure m and n share no prime factors
		let's call this last step optional


m = 2
n = 1
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5

m starts at 2, generate n
for a given m, generate all possible n's
calculate triples from each unique m and n
increase m by 1
